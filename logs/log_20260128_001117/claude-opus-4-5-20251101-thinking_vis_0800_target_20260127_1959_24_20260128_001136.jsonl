I've been in this pattern multiple times.\n\n2. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - I keep rotating to 90°E to check the right side\n   - I haven't been able to clearly identify the destination stores\n   - I keep moving forward and checking again\n\n3. **Critical Assessment**:\n   - Without visual confirmation, I need to make a decision\n   - Either the destination is visible here and I should stop, or I need to continue forward\n   - Given the task mentions \"commercial complex\" with both stores, I should look for a building with multiple storefronts\n\n4. **Decision Logic**:\n   - If I can see commercial buildings with store signage on the right, I should examine them carefully\n   - If I see Café Coffee Day and Subway together, that's the destination\n   - If not clearly visible or identifiable, continue forward\n\n5. **Action**: Since I've been checking repeatedly without clear identification, let me continue forward. I'll rotate back to face forward and move ahead to the next position.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"Continuing forward to search for the commercial complex with Café Coffee Day and Subway further ahead.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(-57, 0)\"\n}\n```"}
