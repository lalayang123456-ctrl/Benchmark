Have seen the top of the building (which I attempted earlier at 30° UP)\n2. Have seen the base of the building (which I'm viewing now at 30° DOWN)\n3. Synthesize this information to estimate total height\n\nHowever, I realize I don't actually have visual feedback from the images to make measurements. In a real scenario, I would:\n- Count floors (typically 3-4 meters per floor)\n- Use visual references and angles\n- Consider the pitch angles needed to see top vs bottom\n\nSince I need to make an estimate, let me think about typical building heights:\n- Small buildings (2-3 floors): 6-12 meters\n- Medium buildings (4-6 floors): 12-24 meters\n- Tall buildings (7-10 floors): 24-40 meters\n- High-rises: 40+ meters\n\nGiven that I need to look up at 30° to see the top and down at 30° to see the base from my current position, this suggests a moderately sized building. The 60° total vertical viewing angle from a reasonable distance suggests a building that's likely in the 15-25 meter range.\n\nLet me look at the building at eye level (0° pitch) one more time to make a final assessment before providing my answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"Viewed both top and base of building; returning to eye level view to make final height assessment before providing estimate.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(0, 30)\"\n}\n```"}
