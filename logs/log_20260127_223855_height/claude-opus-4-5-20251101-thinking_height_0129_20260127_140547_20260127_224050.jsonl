The rotation from 52° by -90° gave me 52 - 90 = -38°, which wraps to 322°... but I ended up at 270° instead. There seems to be an issue with how rotations are being processed.\n\nI'm now at step 13 of 25, and I've been struggling with navigation. Let me try a more direct approach.\n\nFrom 270°W to 322°NW:\n- I need to go right by 52°\n- ROTATION(52, 0)\n\nBut wait, I already tried this in step 11→12 and it took me from 270° to 52° (not 322°).\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the rotation values are being interpreted differently than I think. \n\nLooking at the current image at 270°W, I can see what appears to be a street scene. The building I need to assess should be at 322°NW.\n\nLet me try a smaller rotation increment to see if I can control it better:\n- ROTATION(30, 0) to move toward the target\n\nOr, I could try moving to a different position. Move option 2 (back 13.6m) might give me a better vantage point.\n\nActually, let me try: ROTATION(50, 0) to get closer to 322° from 270°.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"At 270°W again; need to rotate right approximately 52° to reach 322°NW, attempting controlled rotation.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(50, 0)\"\n}\n```"}
