Now I'm at heading 180°S with pitch 0°, looking straight at the building. Let me analyze what I can see:\n\n**Visual Analysis of the Building:**\n- Classical/neoclassical architecture with prominent white columns\n- I can see a colonnade (row of columns) at what appears to be an elevated level\n- There's a base/ground level below the columns\n- The columns appear to span one main story\n- Above the columns, there should be an entablature and pediment (which I saw earlier at pitch 30°)\n- The building appears to have:\n  1. A base/ground level (partially visible)\n  2. A main colonnade level (clearly visible)\n  3. An upper structure with pediment (need to look up to confirm)\n\n**Height Estimation:**\n- Ground/base level: approximately 2-3 meters\n- Main colonnade level: approximately 6-8 meters (columns are tall in classical architecture)\n- Entablature and pediment: approximately 2-3 meters\n- **Total estimated height: 10-14 meters**\n\nHowever, I should look up once more to see the complete top structure to refine my estimate.
