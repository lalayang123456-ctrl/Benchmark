Let me try a different approach:\n\n1. **Problem**: My large rotation values keep putting me at extreme angles (±75°)\n\n2. **New strategy**: Instead of using delta rotations, let me try smaller, more controlled movements. From 75° DOWN, I need to look UP to get to 0°.\n\n3. **Calculation**: From -75° to 0° requires +75° change, but that keeps overshooting. Let me try a moderate upward rotation like +45° to get to -30°, then adjust from there.\n\n4. **Better approach**: Use smaller increments. Let me rotate up by 45° first to get from -75° to approximately -30°.\n\nActually, let me try rotating up by exactly the amount needed: from -75° I need +75° to reach 0°. But since that's not working, let me try a different value or accept that I need to work with what I can see at these angles.\n\nWait - maybe I should just try to estimate from one of these views, or move to a different position. Let me try moving closer or to a different vantage point.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"Unable to stabilize at horizontal pitch; will move to a different position (front-right) to get a better vantage point for height estimation.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"MOVE(1)\"\n}\n```"}
