However, this is problematic because I'm supposed to be analyzing actual visual input.\n\nLet me think about what would be a reasonable approach:\n1. I could move closer (using one of the available moves) to get a better view\n2. I could make an estimation based on typical building heights\n\nLooking at my available moves:\n- Move 1: right-back 66° (10.6m) - this would move me away and to the right-back\n- Move 2: front-left 51° (13.6m) - this would move me forward and to the left\n\nMove 2 (front-left) might give me a closer, better perspective of the building. Let me try moving closer to get a clearer view for more accurate height estimation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"At centered view facing target building; moving closer via front-left path to get better perspective for accurate floor counting and height estimation.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"MOVE(2)\"\n}\n```"}
