This is clearly a systematic issue. \n\nLet me think about this differently. Perhaps I need to:\n1. Set both heading AND pitch in a single rotation command\n2. Use absolute positioning somehow\n\nLooking at the ROTATION specification again: \"ROTATION(yaw_delta, pitch_delta)\" - these are DELTAS (relative changes).\n\nCurrent state: Heading 0°N, Pitch 20°UP\nDesired state: Heading 224°SW, Pitch 20°UP (or higher to see the roof)\n\nTo get to 224° from 0°:\n- yaw_delta = 224° or -136° (I'll use -136° as it's shorter)\n\nTo maintain or increase pitch from 20° to say 40°:\n- pitch_delta = +20°\n\nLet me try: ROTATION(-136, 20) to simultaneously fix heading and increase pitch.\n\nActually, looking at what I can see at heading 0°N with pitch 20°UP - this is NOT the target building. I'm looking in the wrong direction. I need to get back to facing 224°SW.\n\nLet me prioritize: First get the correct heading to 224°, then worry about pitch. I'll use ROTATION(-136, -20) to face 224° and reset pitch to 0°.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"System keeps changing heading when I adjust pitch; I'll rotate to 224°SW and reset pitch to 0° to start fresh with the correct view.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(-136, -20)\"\n}\n```"}
