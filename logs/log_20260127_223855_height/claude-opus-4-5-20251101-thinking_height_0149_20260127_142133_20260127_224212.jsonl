I cannot continue wasting steps on camera control that doesn't work properly.\n\nI need to make a decision NOW based on whatever information I can gather. Let me think about what I know:\n- The task asks for the height of \"the main building\" at approximately 220°SW\n- Typical building heights:\n  - Low-rise (1-3 floors): 3-12 meters\n  - Mid-rise (4-7 floors): 12-25 meters\n  - High-rise (8-20 floors): 25-70 meters\n  - Skyscraper (20+ floors): 70+ meters\n\nSince the task specifically mentions \"the main building\" and asks for an estimate, it's likely a notable structure. Without being able to see the actual image due to the camera control issues, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nGiven that this is a street-level view in what appears to be an urban environment (based on the navigation options and distances), and the building is described as \"the main building,\" it's likely a mid-rise to high-rise structure.\n\nA reasonable estimate for a main building in an urban setting would be around 20-30 meters (approximately 6-9 floors).\n\nLet me provide my best estimate: 24 meters (approximately 8 floors at 3 meters per floor).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"Camera control issues prevent proper observation; based on typical urban main building characteristics, estimating approximately 8 floors at 3m per floor.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"STOP(24.0)\"\n}\n```"}, "available_moves": [{"id": 1, "direction": "right-back 34°", "distance": 9.7, "heading": 123.92123}, {"id": 2, "direction": "front-left 56°", "distance": 9.2, "heading": 303.9692}], "image_path": "temp_images/claude-opus-4-5-20251101-thinking_20260127_224212_height_0149_20260127_142133_20260127224212/step_20.jpg", "agent_type": "agent", "agent_vlm_duration_seconds": 9.701, "reason": "Camera control issues prevent proper observation; based on typical urban main building characteristics, estimating approximately 8 floors at 3m per floor.", "raw_response": "<think>\nThe heading reset AGAIN.
