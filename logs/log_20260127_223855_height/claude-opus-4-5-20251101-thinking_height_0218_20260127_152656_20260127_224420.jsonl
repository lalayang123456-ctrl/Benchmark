The system seems to only allow pitch values of +30, -30, or the current value based on the preset options shown. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the rotation options more carefully, I see I can specify \"Or any custom heading (0-360) and pitch (-85 to 85)\". This means I can set a custom pitch value directly.\n\nLet me use ROTATION with a delta that brings me to 0°:\n- Current pitch: +30°\n- Target pitch: 0°\n- Delta needed: -30°\n\nBut I've been doing this and it's not working as expected. Let me try using a smaller delta to get to pitch 0°. Actually, I should specify the exact delta to reach 0°.\n\nWait - I think the issue is that the pitch changes are cumulative but the system might be resetting or there's something I'm missing. Let me try a custom pitch value of 0 by using delta = -30 from current +30°.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the entire approach. I've now seen the building from multiple angles:\n1. Pitch 0° (Step 1): Middle section visible\n2. Pitch +30° (Steps 2, 4, 6): Upper structure and roofline visible\n3. Pitch -30° (Steps 3, 5): Ground level and base visible\n\nFrom these observations, I can estimate:\n- The building is a classical colonnade structure\n- It appears to have 2-3 visible levels\n- Standard floor height in classical architecture: 4-5 meters\n- Estimated total height: 10-15 meters, likely around 12 meters\n\nLet me try one more rotation to pitch 0° using a precise delta of -30°.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"I'll rotate down by 30 degrees to reach pitch 0° for a complete horizontal view of the building's full height.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(0, -30)\"\n}\n```"}

Let me reconsider: based on all my observations from steps 1-7, I have enough information to estimate the building height:\n\n- Classical colonnade structure\n- 2-3 visible stories\n- Classical architecture typically has 4-5m floor heights\n- Estimated height: 10-15 meters, most likely around 12 meters\n\nBut let me make one more attempt to face the building properly. I'll try rotating by +270° to reach 0°N.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"I'll rotate 270 degrees right to reach North (0°) heading, going the long way around to face the target building.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(270, 0)\"\n}\n```"}
