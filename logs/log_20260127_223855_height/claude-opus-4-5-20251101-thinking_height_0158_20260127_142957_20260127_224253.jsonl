I realize the issue - when I use ROTATION with relative changes, the yaw_delta is relative to current heading, but the system seems to be having issues maintaining the heading when pitch changes.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll use the absolute heading in the rotation. Since I want to be at 76°E with pitch 0°, and I'm currently at 0°N, I need to rotate 76° right with pitch set to 0°.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: I've already seen the building from multiple angles:\n- Upper portion at 30° pitch\n- Lower portion at 20° down pitch\n\nBased on typical building construction, I can estimate:\n- The building appears to be a multi-story structure\n- From the views I've had, it looks like a 6-8 story building\n- Each floor is typically 3-4 meters\n- This would put the building at approximately 18-32 meters\n\nLet me get one more clear view at the proper heading and neutral pitch to make a final estimate. I'll rotate to face 76° with pitch 0°.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"THOUGHT\": \"Need to return to proper viewing angle; rotating to 76°E heading with neutral pitch for final height assessment.\",\n  \"ACTION\": \"ROTATION(76, -20)\"\n}\n```"}
